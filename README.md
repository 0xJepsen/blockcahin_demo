If you want to learn about the cryptography utilized in distributed ledgers take a look at my blog on the topic [here](https://dev.to/0xjepsen/an-introduction-to-cryptography-in-distributed-ledger-technology-268l)

A Blockchain is a acurate and perminent record of transactions. This ledger is also decentralized, meaning it is dictated by noone in patricular. There are many disruptive applications of
